# Knowledge Transfer-Driven Relation Complementation Network
The repo contains official PyTorch Implementation of paper [Knowledge Transfer-Driven Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning]

### Overview
We present a Knowledge Transfer-Driven Relation Complementation Network (KT-RCNet) for few-shot class-incremental learning.
KT-RCNet consists of two main parts, a relation complementation strategy along with a knowledge transfer learning strategy named Random Episode Sampling and Augmentation (RESA). The relation complementation strategy employs a complementary model with a squared Euclidean-distance classifier as the auxiliary module to complement the results given by the widely used cosine classifier. RESA mimics the real incremental setting and constructs pseudo incremental tasks globally and locally to coincide with the learning objective of FSCIL and further improve the model's plasticity, respectively.
